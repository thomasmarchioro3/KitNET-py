# KitNET is a lightweight online anomaly detection algorithm based on an ensemble of autoencoders.
# For more information and citation, please see our NDSS'18 paper: Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection

# This script demonstrates KitNET's ability to incrementally learn, and detect anomalies.
# The demo involves an m-by-n dataset with n=115 dimensions (features), and m=100,000 observations.
# Each observation is a snapshot of the network's state in terms of incremental damped statistics (see the NDSS paper for more details)

#The runtimes presented in the paper, are based on the C++ implimentation (roughly 100x faster than the python implimentation)
